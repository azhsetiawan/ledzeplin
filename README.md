[Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) multi account switcher

I'm using Zeplin and have more than 1 account. If i want to change my account from personal to work or vice versa, i must logout first and login again by typing username and password, long and tedious process. This tool was created to make that process easier.


## Installation
```
brew tap azhsetiawan/tap
brew install ledzeplin
```


## How to use
After installation completed, you must add your account to Keychain one by one using
```
ledzeplin account
```
and you will be prompted to type username and password


## Commands

**switch - autocomplete username**

```
ledzeplin switch [username]
```

**login - autocomplete username**

```
ledzeplin login [username]
```

**logout**

```
ledzeplin logout
```

**show help**

```
ledzeplin help
```
